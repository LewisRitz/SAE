	  		</h3>
	  		<h4>
	  			The Pennsylvania Tau Gamma Chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon began in the early fall of 2002 with the determination of one young man. Greg Brunner rounded up close to 40 gentlemen in the basement of Killinger Hall and began drafting what would be the original by-laws of the 10th fraternity at West Chester University. Greg Brunner, Brad Sorrells, and Matt Barraveccio were named president, vice president, and treasurer, respectively. The founding fathers yearned for a strong commitment to civility, loyalty, scholarship, and brotherhood and swore to not succumb to the pitfalls of other Greek Organizations.
			</h4> 

			<h4>
				Pennsylvania Tau Gamma grew in popularity very quickly; they initiated the inaugural Alpha pledge class, consisting of 13 men, in Spring of 2003. The men of SAE continue striving to be academic, athletic, and respected role models at West Chester University. In April of 2004, the Pennsylvania Tau Gamma received their charter from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon Nationals and became the newest chapter at West Chester University. Subsequently, they were awarded the Greek Cup on campus in 2004 and Greg Brunner was named President of the Year. Currently, the Pennsylvania Tau Gamma has 17 initiated pledge classes, and is recruiting a rapidly growing pool of potential members.
